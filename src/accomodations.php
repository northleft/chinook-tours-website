      <h3>Katmai Wilderness Lodge</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Katmai Wilderness Lodge is not a “bunkhouse” or a “tent camp” style facility. It is the only true lodge having modern and private bathrooms in every guest room, and providing truly gourmet meals on the wild coast of Alaska’s Katmai National Park. The lodge features high quality and personalized guided bear viewing and sports fishing experiences (without the crowds) on the coast of the 3.6 million acre Alaska’s Katmai National Park. Kukak Bay, where the lodge is located, is well known and highly regarded by far-ranging commercial fishermen and other adventurous Alaskans for its concentration of bears and salmon on which they feed.</p>

        <p>We would be honored to share our home with you. Please explore our web-site to get to know us better. Don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions you might have.</p>
