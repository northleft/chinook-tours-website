      <p>Katmai Wilderness Lodge is not a &ldquo;bunkhouse&rdquo; or a &ldquo;tent camp&rdquo; style facility. It is the only true lodge having modern and private bathrooms in every guest room, and providing truly gourmet meals on the wild coast of Alaska&rsquo;s Katmai National Park. The lodge features high quality and personalized guided bear viewing and sports fishing experiences (without the crowds) on the coast of the 3.6 million acre Alaska&rsquo;s Katmai National Park. Kukak Bay, where the lodge is located, is well known and highly regarded by far-ranging commercial fishermen and other adventurous Alaskans for its concentration of bears and salmon on which they feed.</p>

      <p>There are few places in the world better suited to remote salmon fishing than the wild and scenic Alagnak River in Southeastern Alaska.  Never the same year to year, this river's only constant is its large number and diversity of game fish always willing to rise to a fly or attack a shiny spinner.  Arguably, the best way to experience this fishery is spending a week with Alagnak Wilderness Camps.  From the moment you arrive in camp our entire motivation is providing the best fishing trip available.  You'll wonder where the time went when you leave with memories that will endure a lifetime. (Not to mention some of the best tasting wild Sockeye Salmon in the world, which, by the way, won't last nearly as long after you return home.)</p>

      <p>Over 1.5 million people will visit Alaska this year, the vast majority arriving by 3,000+ passenger cruise ships that crowd into a handful of Alaska’s largest ports. While these huge vessels have their onboard attractions, small-ship guests know there’s a better, more intimate way to experience the “real” Alaska: the up-close, casual and personal way.</p>
      <p>Cruise West small ships carry 78 to 138 guests and show you an Alaska the big ships can’t — up narrow channels and into secluded waterways, positioning in the ideal spots and pausing to catch every spectacular display of scenery and wildlife. Sail this summer in the company of naturalist guides and a small number of people who share a passion for exploration and discovery. Experience Alaska at its best with Cruise West. With over 60 years of experience exploring Alaska’s rugged coastlines, ice-carved fjords, towering glaciers and wild interior, not only do we have an intimate knowledge of its land and waters, but we are also allowed more permits than any other cruise line in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Our 8 Alaska itineraries range from 3- and 4-night getaways in Glacier Bay or Prince William Sound to classic Inside Passage trips with true wilderness exploration to epic 25-day cruises to the far reaches of the Bering Sea. All of our cruises can be combined seamlessly with Cruise West land tours in Denali National Park and Preserve, Fairbanks and Anchorage. So no matter what you’re after, you’re bound to find an Alaska vacation that fits your interests, your timeframe and your budget.</p>
