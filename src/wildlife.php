      <h3>Kodiak Treks</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Kodiak Treks offers small group, low-impact bear viewing excursions and world-class adventure from our wilderness lodge, located in the heart of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. For nature enthusiasts looking to experience wild Alaska with a knowledgeable, local guide, our program is designed to make you feel comfortable in bear country as we share our knowledge of Kodiak brown bears&rsquo; life cycle and habitat. One of the few programs in Alaska to offer overnight excursions into bear country, we practice &ldquo;leave no trace&rdquo; ethics on all of our trips. We view non-habituated bear populations and recommend a 3-5 day stay to minimize impact on bears and maximize your Alaskan experience. Offering multiple activities from the lodge, it&rsquo;s easy to enjoy the best Alaska has to offer from one convenient location. Harry Dodge has been hiking and guiding through Kodiak bear country for 30 years. Respected locally as a leader in the field, he is a trained biologist, wildlife advocate, and author, who never tires of introducing guests from around the world to magnificent Kodiak Island and the awesome Kodiak bear.</p>
