      <p>Let us know your preference what you looking for, budget or nice and unique accommodations, B&B&rsquo;s were possible or lodge away from it all. In general, the more remote the more expensive, as it cost a lot to build, maintain, bring supplies out there and also the journey to get there will cost you more.</p>

      <h3>Katmai Wilderness Lodge</h3>
      <p>Katmai Wilderness Lodge is not a &ldquo;bunkhouse&rdquo; or a &ldquo;tent camp&rdquo; style facility. It is the only true lodge having modern and private bathrooms in every guest room, and providing truly gourmet meals on the wild coast of Alaska&rsquo;s Katmai National Park. The lodge features high quality and personalized guided bear viewing and sports fishing experiences (without the crowds) on the coast of the 3.6 million acre Alaska&rsquo;s Katmai National Park. Kukak Bay, where the lodge is located, is well known and highly regarded by far-ranging commercial fishermen and other adventurous Alaskans for its concentration of bears and salmon on which they feed.</p>

      <h3>Kodiak Raspberry Island Remote Lodge</h3>
      <p>As a remote Kodiak Island Wilderness Lodge on Raspberry Island, we are a member of a friendly few who have chosen the pursuit of sharing the unbelievable wilderness we live in with others.</p>
      <p>Kodiak Raspberry Island Remote Lodge has been set up with a &ldquo;roughing it easy&rdquo; feel, offering guests many comforts of the modern world, while all the while hinting at the fact that we are on a Remote Island in the middle of the Kodiak Island Archipelago, Alaska. Our lodge was professionally built by my parents from locally milled Sitka Spruce and is designed to take advantage of the spectacular views of the ocean, mountains and wildlife surrounding our property. A large open kitchen, spacious dining room, and comfortable lounge all welcome guests after a tiring day of fun. Our hydroelectric power is a luxury in the wilderness, and wireless internet keeps us connected to the rest of the world. Only five private guest cabins, our outdoor jetted hot tub and banya (banya is the local word for sauna) emphasize vacation, and our variety of observation decks offer different perspectives on serenity. Rounded out with outstanding cuisine and complimentary beer and wine, we hope to help make your trip to Kodiak, Alaska, and Kodiak Raspberry Island Remote Lodge relaxing, adventuresome and unforgettable.</p>
