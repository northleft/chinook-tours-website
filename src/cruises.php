      <h3>Alaska Charters</h3>
      <div>
        <p>If you want to experience Alaska up close and personal… Gigantic icebergs tumbling into the sea… Eagles over head… Bears catching salmon… Untouched rain forests… Then, Alaska Charters and Adventures can provide your unsurpassed wilderness experience.</p>
        <p>When you are a guest of Alaska Charters and Adventures, you are special, not a number in a crowd. We will know what your specific interests, limitations and experiential goals are for each excursion even before you arrive. Because our boats travel with 6 or fewer clients (unless your group is larger) we are better able to cater to your objectives and timeframes. Alaska Charters and Adventures carefully tailors every excursion to your personal schedule, interests, and with hopes of exceeding your expectations in every way.</p>

      <h3>Discover Cruise West's Alaska Cruises</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Over 1.5 million people will visit Alaska this year, the vast majority arriving by 3,000+ passenger cruise ships that crowd into a handful of Alaska’s largest ports. While these huge vessels have their onboard attractions, small-ship guests know there’s a better, more intimate way to experience the “real” Alaska: the up-close, casual and personal way.</p>
        <p>Cruise West small ships carry 78 to 138 guests and show you an Alaska the big ships can’t — up narrow channels and into secluded waterways, positioning in the ideal spots and pausing to catch every spectacular display of scenery and wildlife. Sail this summer in the company of naturalist guides and a small number of people who share a passion for exploration and discovery. Experience Alaska at its best with Cruise West. With over 60 years of experience exploring Alaska’s rugged coastlines, ice-carved fjords, towering glaciers and wild interior, not only do we have an intimate knowledge of its land and waters, but we are also allowed more permits than any other cruise line in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Our 8 Alaska itineraries range from 3- and 4-night getaways in Glacier Bay or Prince William Sound to classic Inside Passage trips with true wilderness exploration to epic 25-day cruises to the far reaches of the Bering Sea. All of our cruises can be combined seamlessly with Cruise West land tours in Denali National Park and Preserve, Fairbanks and Anchorage. So no matter what you’re after, you’re bound to find an Alaska vacation that fits your interests, your timeframe and your budget.</p>
